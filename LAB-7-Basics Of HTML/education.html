            <h2>S.N.Patel Institute Of Technology (2018-2022)</h2>
            <p>My favourite class of this school is machine learning. The way professor used to teach us is very practical. She always focuses on practical knowledge of the subject rather than theoretical part. I enjoyed so much while perfoming the practical assignments of this class.</p>
            <aside>My memorable memory from this school is annual function in which i was awarded as student of the year 2022</aside>
