            This story is most recent story. So i am from india and in india the diwali is the biggest festival. So from the childhood diwali is my favourite festival.

            So when diwali comes i became too much crazy. I decorate my home with electrical light all by my self. I help my mom in home decoration. I enjoy crackers so much that someone watching me lightening crackers almost belives that i am mental. &#128517; I play badminton late night and cricket all long day with my friends. I go for outing with my friends and family members.

            But then i decided to come here for my masters. The day i came in NJ i started missing my family and when diwali came i started missing my home enjoying diwali with my family and friends so much that i can't express in words. When i see others enjoying diwali with their friends here i feel too much low. The sad thing is i becuase if the lot of assignments i am not even able to go and see others enjoying and celebrating diwali here in the US.
